      <p>The problem most music streaming user can face:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid subscription</li>
        <li>Required account</li>
        <li>Application download</li>
        <li>Confusing UI</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My goal on this project was to work towards removing these problems
      within the music streaming industry using Bloc Jams. It is <strong>simple</strong>
      to use on any device, with an easy to understand UI and comfortable
      to use button placement. Bloc jams' also holds <em>responsive</em> and <em>easy</em> controls
      without the use of any downloaded content, leaving all the hard work to us,
      and the relaxing music to the user all for <strong><em>free!</em></strong></p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>This site was an amazing learning experience for myself, and will be
      an ongoing project for myself as i discover more ways to imporve on Bloc Jams.
       My biggest learning expereince was the seek bar for the music, and the volume
      control. It was a difficult task at first trying to organize the logic behind
      how it should function, but after some debugging, i was able to get it working
      better than i expected, and felt some extreme accomplishment. Everything else
      i attempted works great, for instance, the album screen works as expected,
      and can load a dynamic amount of albums that are required, and the music player-bar
      works wonderfully and just as i hoped. </p>
