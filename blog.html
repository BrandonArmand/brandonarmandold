          <h1>My Goals</h1>
          <h2>June 8, 2017</h2>
          <p>I began programming as young as 9 or 10 just creating some simple batch
          files to do some <em>very</em> simple tasks. I eventually took over C++ years later
          and created some complex applications to push my creativity and logic
          thinking skills to the limit; however, after some time i decided to move on and learn
          javascript, and with javascript came HTML, CSS, and JQuery. Although I didn't just
          decide to learn to program as only just a hobby though, i had some goals in mind.
          I wanted to be able to program quickly, professionally, and write some
          impressive code along the way. These goals never left me, and i still
          aspire to become a very strong programmer, and never stop learning.
          There is a never ending amount of information out in the world, and i love discovering
          every little bit of it. Programming has been in my life since the beginning
          , and it will stay here for the rest of my life while i head toward my never ending
          goal to become a better programmer.</p>
          <p>My ideology to keep learning isn't unnusual though, i beleive every
          programmer out there should have this mentality, without it, how else
          are we meant to imporve? Everyone should set a goal to continue to improve,
          and become the very best that they can. There are plenty of resources
           available to help imporve with logical thinking, learning helpful algorithims
          or learning amazing new frameworks, Plus teaching yourself things like
          machine learning, and descrete math can drastically change the way you
          think about computer science and programming. I recommend all programmers
          to spend some time every day to learn just a little bit more.</p>
